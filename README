Worked with the rest of the group as instructed on the back end. I tried using Amazon web services in order to connect to the front end of
project however Yousif was able to get his back end to work first so we ended up using his version. I have also pulled together some 
good questions for our survey and it is ready to send out.


I spent this sprint looking into creating a test Mongo database in order to try using my sorting algorithm on that data so that when our real back end is prepared it can be more easily
integrated. I also spent time putting together a survey that we would like to eventually send to the class in order for us to have real data to work with instead of the fake
data we have now.
